## Goal

This workshop, 'R/Bioconductor Workshop for Genomic Data Analysis', is designed to introduce attendees to Bioconductor and a variety of its use cases; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  Users will apply their knowledge of basic R operations to data structures that are commonly encountered in the field of computational biology like sequence data.  They will come to understand how to use R/Bioconductor to interact with common file types used in bioinformatics, receive an introduction to ontology-based analysis for deriving practical insights from the data, and then visualize the end result.


## Workshop Topic Overview

 The topics presented herein include the following:

* Intro to R and Bioconductor Basic Concepts
   * Brief review of R syntax
   * Introduction to the Bioconductor repository
   * Overview of motivations, data structures, and data management for genome-scale experiments

* Working with General Genomic Features Using Genomic Ranges
   * Introduction to Bioconductor 'ranges' package series
   * Range-oriented solutions for current experimental paradigms including RNA-seq and 450k methylation data
   * Parsing of BAM or BED formats and VCF file handling

* Genomic Annotation with Bioconductor
   * General overview of Bioconductor annotation
   * Introduction to Ontology concepts and tools

* Visualization of Genome-Scale Data
   * Overview of visualization tasks
   * Strategies for optimal visualization
   * Annotation-oriented visualizations
